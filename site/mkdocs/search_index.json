            "text": "Yield and Generators\n\n\nCoroutines and Subroutines\n\n\nWhen we call a normal Python function, execution starts at function's first line and continues until a return statement, exception, or the end of the function (which is seen as an implicit return None) is encountered. Once a function returns control to its caller, that's it. Any work done by the function and stored in local variables is lost. A new call to the function creates everything from scratch.\n\n\nThis is all very standard when discussing functions (more generally referred to as subroutines) in computer programming. There are times, though, when it's beneficial to have the ability to create a \"function\" which, instead of simply returning a single value, is able to yield a series of values. To do so, such a function would need to be able to \"save its work,\" so to speak.\n\n\nI said, \"yield a series of values\" because our hypothetical function doesn't \"return\" in the normal sense. return implies that the function is returning control of execution to the point where the function was called. \"Yield,\" however, implies that the transfer of control is temporary and voluntary, and our function expects to regain it in the future.\n\n\nIn Python, \"functions\" with these capabilities are called generators, and they're incredibly useful. generators (and the yield statement) were initially introduced to give programmers a more straightforward way to write code responsible for producing a series of values. Previously, creating something like a random number generator required a class or module that both generated values and kept track of state between calls. With the introduction of generators, this became much simpler.\n\n\nTo better understand the problem generators solve, let's take a look at an example. Throughout the example, keep in mind the core problem being solved: generating a series of values.\n\n\nNote: Outside of Python, all but the simplest generators would be referred to as coroutines. I'll use the latter term later in the post. The important thing to remember is, in Python, everything described here as a coroutine is still a generator. Python formally defines the term generator; coroutine is used in discussion but has no formal definition in the language.\n\n\nExample: Fun With Prime Numbers\n\n\nSuppose our boss asks us to write a function that takes a list of ints and returns some Iterable containing the elements which are prime1 numbers.\n\n\nRemember, an Iterable is just an object capable of returning its members one at a time.\n\n\n\"Simple,\" we say, and we write the following:\n\n\ndef get_primes(input_list):\n    result_list = list()\n    for element in input_list:\n        if is_prime(element):\n            result_list.append()\n\n    return result_list\n\n\n\n\nor better yet...\n\n\ndef get_primes(input_list):\n    return (element for element in input_list if is_prime(element))\n\n# not germane to the example, but here's a possible implementation of\n# is_prime...\n\ndef is_prime(number):\n    if number \n 1:\n        if number == 2:\n            return True\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            return False\n        for current in range(3, int(math.sqrt(number) + 1), 2):\n            if number % current == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n    return False\n\n\n\n\nEither get_primes implementation above fulfills the requirements, so we tell our boss we're done. She reports our function works and is exactly what she wanted.\n\n\nDealing With Infinite Sequences\n\n\nWell, not quite exactly. A few days later, our boss comes back and tells us she's run into a small problem: she wants to use our get_primes function on a very large list of numbers. In fact, the list is so large that merely creating it would consume all of the system's memory. To work around this, she wants to be able to call get_primes with a start value and get all the primes larger than start (perhaps she's solving Project Euler problem 10).\n\n\nOnce we think about this new requirement, it becomes clear that it requires more than a simple change to get_primes. Clearly, we can't return a list of all the prime numbers from start to infinity (operating on infinite sequences, though, has a wide range of useful applications). The chances of solving this problem using a normal function seem bleak.\n\n\nBefore we give up, let's determine the core obstacle preventing us from writing a function that satisfies our boss's new requirements. Thinking about it, we arrive at the following: functions only get one chance to return results, and thus must return all results at once. It seems pointless to make such an obvious statement; \"functions just work that way,\" we think. The real value lies in asking, \"but what if they didn't?\"\n\n\nImagine what we could do if get_primes could simply return the next value instead of all the values at once. It wouldn't need to create a list at all. No list, no memory issues. Since our boss told us she's just iterating over the results, she wouldn't know the difference.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this doesn't seem possible. Even if we had a magical function that allowed us to iterate from n to infinity, we'd get stuck after returning the first value:\n\n\ndef get_primes(start):\n    for element in magical_infinite_range(start):\n        if is_prime(element):\n            return element\n\n\n\n\nImagine get_primes is called like so:\n\n\ndef solve_number_10():\n    # She *is* working on Project Euler #10, I knew it!\n    total = 2\n    for next_prime in get_primes(3):\n        if next_prime \n 2000000:\n            total += next_prime\n        else:\n            print(total)\n            return\n\n\n\n\nClearly, in get_primes, we would immediately hit the case where number = 3 and return at line 4. Instead of return, we need a way to generate a value and, when asked for the next one, pick up where we left off.\n\n\nFunctions, though, can't do this. When they return, they're done for good. Even if we could guarantee a function would be called again, we have no way of saying, \"OK, now, instead of starting at the first line like we normally do, start up where we left off at line 4.\" Functions have a single entry point: the first line.\n\n\nEnter the Generator\n\n\nThis sort of problem is so common that a new construct was added to Python to solve it: the generator. A generator \"generates\" values. Creating generators was made as straightforward as possible through the concept of generator functions, introduced simultaneously.\n\n\nA generator function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function (even if it also contains a return statement). There's nothing else we need to do to create one.\n\n\ngenerator functions create generator iterators. That's the last time you'll see the term generator iterator, though, since they're almost always referred to as \"generators\". Just remember that a generator is a special type of iterator. To be considered an iterator, generators must define a few methods, one of which is \nnext\n(). To get the next value from a generator, we use the same built-in function as for iterators: next().\n\n\nThis point bears repeating: to get the next value from a generator, we use the same built-in function as for iterators: next().\n\n\n(next() takes care of calling the generator's \nnext\n() method). Since a generator is a type of iterator, it can be used in a for loop.\n\n\nSo whenever next() is called on a generator, the generator is responsible for passing back a value to whomever called next(). It does so by calling yield along with the value to be passed back (e.g. yield 7). The easiest way to remember what yield does is to think of it as return (plus a little magic) for generator functions.**\n\n\nAgain, this bears repeating: yield is just return (plus a little magic) for generator functions.\n\n\nHere's a simple generator function:\n\n\n def simple_generator_function():\n\n    yield 1\n\n    yield 2\n\n    yield 3\n\n\n\n\nAnd here are two simple ways to use it:\n\n\n for value in simple_generator_function():\n\n     print(value)\n1\n2\n3\n\n our_generator = simple_generator_function()\n\n next(our_generator)\n1\n\n next(our_generator)\n2\n\n next(our_generator)\n3\n\n\n\n\nMagic?\n\n\nWhat's the magic part? Glad you asked! When a generator function calls yield, the \"state\" of the generator function is frozen; the values of all variables are saved and the next line of code to be executed is recorded until next() is called again. Once it is, the generator function simply resumes where it left off. If next() is never called again, the state recorded during the yield call is (eventually) discarded.\n\n\nLet's rewrite get_primes as a generator function. Notice that we no longer need the magical_infinite_range function. Using a simple while loop, we can create our own infinite sequence:\n\n\ndef get_primes(number):\n    while True:\n        if is_prime(number):\n            yield number\n        number += 1\n\n\n\n\nIf a generator function calls return or reaches the end its definition, a StopIteration exception is raised. This signals to whoever was calling next() that the generator is exhausted (this is normal iterator behavior). It is also the reason the while True: loop is present in get_primes. If it weren't, the first time next() was called we would check if the number is prime and possibly yield it. If next() were called again, we would uselessly add 1 to number and hit the end of the generator function (causing StopIteration to be raised). Once a generator has been exhausted, calling next() on it will result in an error, so you can only consume all the values of a generator once. The following will not work:\n\n\n our_generator = simple_generator_function()\n\n for value in our_generator:\n\n     print(value)\n\n\n # our_generator has been exhausted...\n\n print(next(our_generator))\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \nipython-input-13-7e48a609051a\n, line 1, in \nmodule\n\n    next(our_generator)\nStopIteration\n\n\n # however, we can always create a new generator\n\n # by calling the generator function again...\n\n\n new_generator = simple_generator_function()\n\n print(next(new_generator)) # perfectly valid\n1\n\n\n\n\nThus, the while loop is there to make sure we never reach the end of get_primes. It allows us to generate a value for as long as next() is called on the generator. This is a common idiom when dealing with infinite series (and generators in general).\n\n\nVisualizing the flow\n\n\nLet's go back to the code that was calling get_primes: solve_number_10.\n\n\ndef solve_number_10():\n    # She *is* working on Project Euler #10, I knew it!\n    total = 2\n    for next_prime in get_primes(3):\n        if next_prime \n 2000000:\n            total += next_prime\n        else:\n            print(total)\n            return\n\n\n\n\nIt's helpful to visualize how the first few elements are created when we call get_primes in solve_number_10's for loop. When the for loop requests the first value from get_primes, we enter get_primes as we would in a normal function.\n\n\n\n\nWe enter the while loop on line 3\n\n\nThe if condition holds (3 is prime)\n\n\nWe yield the value 3 and control to solve_number_10.\n\n\n\n\nThen, back in solve_number_10:\n\n\n\n\nThe value 3 is passed back to the for loop\n\n\nThe for loop assigns next_prime to this value\n\n\nnext_prime is added to total\n\n\nThe for loop requests the next element from get_primes\n\n\n\n\nThis time, though, instead of entering get_primes back at the top, we resume at line 5, where we left off.\n\n\ndef get_primes(number):\n    while True:\n        if is_prime(number):\n            yield number\n        number += 1 # \n\n\n\n\n\nMost importantly, number still has the same value it did when we called yield (i.e. 3). Remember, yield both passes a value to whoever called next(), and saves the \"state\" of the generator function. Clearly, then, number is incremented to 4, we hit the top of the while loop, and keep incrementing number until we hit the next prime number (5). Again we yield the value of number to the for loop in solve_number_10. This cycle continues until the for loop stops (at the first prime greater than 2,000,000).\n\n\nMoar Power\n\n\nIn PEP 342, support was added for passing values into generators. PEP 342 gave generators the power to yield a value (as before), receive a value, or both yield a value and receive a (possibly different) value in a single statement.\n\n\nTo illustrate how values are sent to a generator, let's return to our prime number example. This time, instead of simply printing every prime number greater than number, we'll find the smallest prime number greater than successive powers of a number (i.e. for 10, we want the smallest prime greater than 10, then 100, then 1000, etc.). We start in the same way as get_primes:\n\n\ndef print_successive_primes(iterations, base=10):\n    # like normal functions, a generator function\n    # can be assigned to a variable\n\n    prime_generator = get_primes(base)\n    # missing code...\n    for power in range(iterations):\n        # missing code...\n\ndef get_primes(number):\n    while True:\n        if is_prime(number):\n        # ... what goes here?\n\n\n\n\nThe next line of get_primes takes a bit of explanation. While yield number would yield the value of number, a statement of the form other = yield foo means, \"yield foo and, when a value is sent to me, set other to that value.\" You can \"send\" values to a generator using the generator's send method.\n\n\ndef get_primes(number):\n    while True:\n        if is_prime(number):\n            number = yield number\n        number += 1\n\n\n\n\nIn this way, we can set number to a different value each time the generator yields. We can now fill in the missing code in print_successive_primes:\n\n\ndef print_successive_primes(iterations, base=10):\n    prime_generator = get_primes(base)\n    prime_generator.send(None)\n    for power in range(iterations):\n        print(prime_generator.send(base ** power))\n\n\n\n\nTwo things to note here: First, we're printing the result of generator.send, which is possible because send both sends a value to the generator and returns the value yielded by the generator (mirroring how yield works from within the generator function).\n\n\nSecond, notice the prime_generator.send(None) line. When you're using send to \"start\" a generator (that is, execute the code from the first line of the generator function up to the first yield statement), you must send None. This makes sense, since by definition the generator hasn't gotten to the first yield statement yet, so if we sent a real value there would be nothing to \"receive\" it. Once the generator is started, we can send values as we do above.\n\n\nRound-up\n\n\nIn the second half of this series, we'll discuss the various ways in which generators have been enhanced and the power they gained as a result. yield has become one of the most powerful keywords in Python. Now that we've built a solid understanding of how yield works, we have the knowledge necessary to understand some of the more \"mind-bending\" things that yield can be used for.\n\n\nBelieve it or not, we've barely scratched the surface of the power of yield. For example, while send does work as described above, it's almost never used when generating simple sequences like our example. Below, I've pasted a small demonstration of one common way send is used. I'll not say any more about it as figuring out how and why it works will be a good warm-up for part two.\n\n\nimport random\n\ndef get_data():\n    \nReturn 3 random integers between 0 and 9\n\n    return random.sample(range(10), 3)\n\ndef consume():\n    \nDisplays a running average across lists of integers sent to it\n\n    running_sum = 0\n    data_items_seen = 0\n\n    while True:\n        data = yield\n        data_items_seen += len(data)\n        running_sum += sum(data)\n        print('The running average is {}'.format(running_sum / float(data_items_seen)))\n\ndef produce(consumer):\n    \nProduces a set of values and forwards them to the pre-defined consumer\n    function\n\n    while True:\n        data = get_data()\n        print('Produced {}'.format(data))\n        consumer.send(data)\n        yield\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    consumer = consume()\n    consumer.send(None)\n    producer = produce(consumer)\n\n    for _ in range(10):\n        print('Producing...')\n        next(producer)\n\n\n\n\nRemember...\n\n\nThere are a few key ideas I hope you take away from this discussion:\n\n\n\n\ngenerators are used to generate a series of values\n\n\nyield is like the return of generator functions\n\n\nThe only other thing yield does is save the \"state\" of a generator function\n\n\nA generator is just a special type of iterator\n\n\nLike iterators, we can get the next value from a generator using next()\n\n\nfor gets values by calling next() implicitly",

            "text": "When we call a normal Python function, execution starts at function's first line and continues until a return statement, exception, or the end of the function (which is seen as an implicit return None) is encountered. Once a function returns control to its caller, that's it. Any work done by the function and stored in local variables is lost. A new call to the function creates everything from scratch.  This is all very standard when discussing functions (more generally referred to as subroutines) in computer programming. There are times, though, when it's beneficial to have the ability to create a \"function\" which, instead of simply returning a single value, is able to yield a series of values. To do so, such a function would need to be able to \"save its work,\" so to speak.  I said, \"yield a series of values\" because our hypothetical function doesn't \"return\" in the normal sense. return implies that the function is returning control of execution to the point where the function was called. \"Yield,\" however, implies that the transfer of control is temporary and voluntary, and our function expects to regain it in the future.  In Python, \"functions\" with these capabilities are called generators, and they're incredibly useful. generators (and the yield statement) were initially introduced to give programmers a more straightforward way to write code responsible for producing a series of values. Previously, creating something like a random number generator required a class or module that both generated values and kept track of state between calls.

We enter the while loop on line 3  The if condition holds (3 is prime)  We yield the value 3 and control to solve_number_10.   Then, back in solve_number_10:   The value 3 is passed back to the for loop  The for loop assigns next_prime to this value  next_prime is added to total  The for loop requests the next element from get_primes   This time, though, instead of entering get_primes back at the top, we resume at line 5, where we left off.  def get_primes(number):\n    while True:\n        if is_prime(number):\n            yield number\n        number += 1 #    Most importantly, number still has the same value it did when we called yield (i.e. 3). Remember, yield both passes a value to whoever called next(), and saves the \"state\" of the generator function. Clearly, then, number is incremented to 4, we hit the top of the while loop, and keep incrementing number until we hit the next prime number (5). Again we yield the value of number to the for loop in solve_number_10. This cycle continues until the for loop stops (at the first prime greater than 2,000,000).",

            "text": "In PEP 342, support was added for passing values into generators. PEP 342 gave generators the power to yield a value (as before), receive a value, or both yield a value and receive a (possibly different) value in a single statement.  To illustrate how values are sent to a generator, let's return to our prime number example. This time, instead of simply printing every prime number greater than number, we'll find the smallest prime number greater than successive powers of a number (i.e. for 10, we want the smallest prime greater than 10, then 100, then 1000, etc.). We start in the same way as get_primes:  def print_successive_primes(iterations, base=10):\n    # like normal functions, a generator function\n    # can be assigned to a variable\n\n    prime_generator = get_primes(base)\n    # missing code...\n    for power in range(iterations):\n        # missing code...\n\ndef get_primes(number):\n    while True:\n        if is_prime(number):\n        # ... what goes here?  The next line of get_primes takes a bit of explanation. While yield number would yield the value of number, a statement of the form other = yield foo means, \"yield foo and, when a value is sent to me, set other to that value.\" You can \"send\" values to a generator using the generator's send method.  def get_primes(number):\n    while True:\n        if is_prime(number):\n            number = yield number\n        number += 1  In this way, we can set number to a different value each time the generator yields. We can now fill in the missing code in print_successive_primes:  def print_successive_primes(iterations, base=10):\n    prime_generator = get_primes(base)\n    prime_generator.send(None)\n    for power in range(iterations):\n        print(prime_generator.send(base ** power))  Two things to note here: First, we're printing the result of generator.send, which is possible because send both sends a value to the generator and returns the value yielded by the generator (mirroring how yield works from within the generator function).  Second, notice the prime_generator.send(None) line. When you're using send to \"start\" a generator (that is, execute the code from the first line of the generator function up to the first yield statement), you must send None. This makes sense, since by definition the generator hasn't gotten to the first yield statement yet, so if we sent a real value there would be nothing to \"receive\" it. Once the generator is started, we can send values as we do above.",

Believe it or not, we've barely scratched the surface of the power of yield. For example, while send does work as described above, it's almost never used when generating simple sequences like our example.

Most Popular Operations    Create a set    x = set([\"Postcard\", \"Radio\", \"Telegram\"])      Add elements to a set    x.add(\"Mobile\")      Remove elements to a set    x.remove(\"Radio\")      Subset    y.issubset(x)      Intersection    x.intersection(y)      Difference between two sets    x.difference(y)",

            "text": "Object Oriented Programming\n\n\nPython has been an object-oriented language since it existed. Because of this, creating and using classes and objects are downright easy. This chapter helps you become an expert in using Python's object-oriented programming support.\n\n\nIf you do not have any previous experience with object-oriented (OO) programming, you may want to consult an introductory course on it or at least a tutorial of some sort so that you have a grasp of the basic concepts.\n\n\nClasses and Objects\n\n\nClasses can be thought of as blueprints for creating objects. When I define a \nBankAccount\n class using the class keyword, I haven't actually created a bank account. Instead, what I've created is a sort of instruction manual for constructing \"bank account\" objects. Let's look at the following example code:\n\n\nclass BankAccount:\n    id = None\n    balance = 0\n\n    def __init__(self, id, balance=0):\n        self.id = id\n        self.balance = balance\n\n    def __get_balance(self):\n        return self.balance\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        self.balance = self.balance - amount\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance = self.balance + amount\n\njohn = BankAccount(1, 1000.0)\njohn.withdraw(100.0)\n\n\n\n\nThe \nclass BankAccount\n line \ndoes not\n create a new bank account. That is, just because we've \ndefined\n a \nBankAcount\n doesn't mean we've \ncreated\n on; we've merely outlined the \nblueprint\n to create a \nBankAccount\n object. To do so, we call the class's \n__init__\n method with the proper number of arguments (minus \nself\n, which we'll get to in a moment)\n\n\nSo, to use the \"blueprint\" that we crated by defining the \nclass BankAccount\n (which is used to create \nBankAccount\n objects), we call the class name almost as if it were a function: \njohn = BankAccount(1, 1000.0)\n. This line simple say \"use the \nBankAccount\n blueprint to create me a new object, which I'll refer to as \njohn\n\".\n\n\nThe \njohn\n \nobject\n, known as an \ninstance\n, is the realized version of the \nBankAccount\n \nclass\n. Before we called \nBankAccount()\n, no \nBankAccount\n object existed. We can, of course, create as many \nBankAccount\n objects as we'd like. There is still, however, only one \nBankAccount\n \nclass\n, regardless of how many \ninstances\n of the class we create.\n\n\nself\n\n\nSo what's with that \nself\n parameter to all of the \nBankAccount\n methods? What is it? Why, it's the instance, of course! Put another way, a method like withdraw defines the instructions for withdrawing money from some abstract customer's account. Calling \njohn.withdraw(100)\n puts those instructions to use on the \njohn\n instance.\n\n\nSo when we say def \nwithdraw(self, amount)\n:, we're saying, \"here's how you withdraw money from a \nBankAccount\n object (which we'll call \nself\n) and a dollar figure (which we'll call \namount\n). \nself\n is the \ninstance\n of the \nBankAccount\n that \nwithdraw\n is being called on. That's not me making analogies, either. \njohn.withdraw(100.0)\n is just shorthand for \nBankAccount.withdraw(john, 100.0)\n, which is perfectly valid (if not often seen) code.\n\n\nConstructors: \n__init__\n\n\nself\n may make sense for other methods, but what about \n__init__\n? When we call \n__init__\n, we're in the process of creating an object, so how can there already be a \nself\n? Python allows us to extend the \nself\n pattern to when objects are constructed as well, even though it doesn't \nexactly\n fit. Just imagine that \njohn = (1, 1000.0)\n is the same as calling \njohn = BankAccount(john, 1, 1000.0)\n; the \njohn\n that's passed in is also made the result.\n\n\nThis is why when we call \n__init__\n, we initialize objects by saying things like \nself.id = id\n. Remember, since \nself\n is the instance, this is equivalent to saying \njohn.id = id\n, which is the same as \njohn.id= 1\n. Similarly, \nself.balance = balance\n is the same as \njohn.balance = 1000.0\n. After these two lines, we consider the \nBankAccount\n object \"initialized\" and ready for use.\n\n\nBe careful what you \n__init__\n\n\nAfter \n__init__\n has finished, the caller can rightly assume that the object is ready to use. That is, after \njohn = BankAccount(1, 1000.0)\n, we can start making \ndeposit\n and \nwithdraw\n calls on \njohn\n; \njohn\n is a \nfully-initialized\n object.\n\n\nInheritance\n\n\nWhile Object-oriented Programming is useful as a modeling tool, it truly gains power when the concept of \ninheritance\n is introduced. \nInheritance\n is the process by which a \"child\" class \nderives\n the data and behavior of a \"parent\" class. An example will definitely help us here.\n\n\nImagine we run a car dealership. We sell all types of vehicles, from motorcycles to trucks. We set ourselves apart from the competition by our prices. Specifically, how we determine the price of a vehicle on our lot: $5,000 x number of wheels a vehicle has. We love buying back our vehicles as well. We offer a flat rate - 10% of the miles driven on the vehicle. For trucks, that rate is $10,000. For cars, $8,000. For motorcycles, $4,000.\n\n\nIf we wanted to create a sales system for our dealership using Object-oriented techniques, how would we do so? What would the objects be? We might have a \nSale\n class, a \nCustomer\n class, an \nInventory\n class, and so forth, but we'd almost certainly have a \nCar\n, \nTruck\n, and \nMotorcycle\n class.\n\n\nWhat would these classes look like? Using what we've learned, here's a possible implementation of the \nCar\n class:\n\n\nclass Car(object):\n    def __init__(self, wheels, miles, make, model, year, sold_on):\n        self.wheels = wheels\n        self.miles = miles\n        self.make = make\n        self.model = model\n        self.year = year\n        self.sold_on = sold_on\n\n    def sale_price(self):\n        if self.sold_on is not None:\n            return 0.0  # Already sold\n        return 5000.0 * self.wheels\n\n    def purchase_price(self):\n        if self.sold_on is None:\n            return 0.0  # Not yet sold\n        return 8000 - (.10 * self.miles)\n\n\n\n\nOK, that looks pretty reasonable. Of course, we would likely have a number of other methods on the class, but I've shown two of particular interest to us: \nsale_price\n and \npurchase_price\n. We'll see why these are important in a bit.\n\n\nNow that we've got the \nCar\n class, perhaps we should create a \nTruck\n class? Let's follow the same pattern we did for car:\n\n\nclass Truck(object):\n    def __init__(self, wheels, miles, make, model, year, sold_on):\n        self.wheels = wheels\n        self.miles = miles\n        self.make = make\n        self.model = model\n        self.year = year\n        self.sold_on = sold_on\n\n    def sale_price(self):\n        if self.sold_on is not None:\n            return 0.0  # Already sold\n        return 5000.0 * self.wheels\n\n    def purchase_price(self):\n        if self.sold_on is None:\n            return 0.0  # Not yet sold\n        return 10000 - (.10 * self.miles)\n\n\n\n\nWow.

Our main problem is that we raced straight to the concrete: \nCar\n and \nTruck\n are real things, tangible objects that make intuitive sense as classes.

Indeed there is: the notion of \nVehicle\n.\n\n\nAbstract Classes\n\n\nA \nVehicle\n is not a real-world object. Rather, it is a \nconcept\n that some real-world objects (like cars, trucks, and motorcycles) embody. We would like to use the fact that each of these objects can be considered a vehicle to remove repeated code. We can do that by creating a \nVehicle\n class:\n\n\nclass Vehicle(object):\n    base_sale_price = 0\n\n    def __init__(self, wheels, miles, make, model, year, sold_on):\n        self.wheels = wheels\n        self.miles = miles\n        self.make = make\n        self.model = model\n        self.year = year\n        self.sold_on = sold_on\n\n\n    def sale_price(self):\n        if self.sold_on is not None:\n            return 0.0  # Already sold\n        return 5000.0 * self.wheels\n\n    def purchase_price(self):\n        if self.sold_on is None:\n            return 0.0  # Not yet sold\n        return self.base_sale_price - (.10 * self.miles)\n\n\n\n\nNow we can make the \nCar\n and \nTruck\n class \ninherit\n from the \nVehicle\n class by replacing \nobject\n in the line class \nCar(object)\n. The class in parenthesis is the class that is inherited from (\nobject\n essentially means \"no inheritance\".

Instead, what I've created is a sort of instruction manual for constructing \"bank account\" objects. Let's look at the following example code:  class BankAccount:\n    id = None\n    balance = 0\n\n    def __init__(self, id, balance=0):\n        self.id = id\n        self.balance = balance\n\n    def __get_balance(self):\n        return self.balance\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        self.balance = self.balance - amount\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        self.balance = self.balance + amount\n\njohn = BankAccount(1, 1000.0)\njohn.withdraw(100.0)  The  class BankAccount  line  does not  create a new bank account. That is, just because we've  defined  a  BankAcount  doesn't mean we've  created  on; we've merely outlined the  blueprint  to create a  BankAccount  object. To do so, we call the class's  __init__  method with the proper number of arguments (minus  self , which we'll get to in a moment)  So, to use the \"blueprint\" that we crated by defining the  class BankAccount  (which is used to create  BankAccount  objects), we call the class name almost as if it were a function:  john = BankAccount(1, 1000.0) . This line simple say \"use the  BankAccount  blueprint to create me a new object, which I'll refer to as  john \".  The  john   object , known as an  instance , is the realized version of the  BankAccount   class . Before we called  BankAccount() , no  BankAccount  object existed. We can, of course, create as many  BankAccount  objects as we'd like. There is still, however, only one  BankAccount   class , regardless of how many  instances  of the class we create.",

So when we say def  withdraw(self, amount) :, we're saying, \"here's how you withdraw money from a  BankAccount  object (which we'll call  self ) and a dollar figure (which we'll call  amount ).  self  is the  instance  of the  BankAccount  that  withdraw  is being called on.

Just imagine that  john = (1, 1000.0)  is the same as calling  john = BankAccount(john, 1, 1000.0) ; the  john  that's passed in is also made the result.  This is why when we call  __init__ , we initialize objects by saying things like  self.id = id . Remember, since  self  is the instance, this is equivalent to saying  john.id = id , which is the same as  john.id= 1 . Similarly,  self.balance = balance  is the same as  john.balance = 1000.0 .

Inheritance  is the process by which a \"child\" class  derives  the data and behavior of a \"parent\" class. An example will definitely help us here.  Imagine we run a car dealership. We sell all types of vehicles, from motorcycles to trucks. We set ourselves apart from the competition by our prices. Specifically, how we determine the price of a vehicle on our lot: $5,000 x number of wheels a vehicle has. We love buying back our vehicles as well. We offer a flat rate - 10% of the miles driven on the vehicle. For trucks, that rate is $10,000. For cars, $8,000. For motorcycles, $4,000.  If we wanted to create a sales system for our dealership using Object-oriented techniques, how would we do so? What would the objects be? We might have a  Sale  class, a  Customer  class, an  Inventory  class, and so forth, but we'd almost certainly have a  Car ,  Truck , and  Motorcycle  class.  What would these classes look like? Using what we've learned, here's a possible implementation of the  Car  class:  class Car(object):\n    def __init__(self, wheels, miles, make, model, year, sold_on):\n        self.wheels = wheels\n        self.miles = miles\n        self.make = make\n        self.model = model\n        self.year = year\n        self.sold_on = sold_on\n\n    def sale_price(self):\n        if self.sold_on is not None:\n            return 0.0  # Already sold\n        return 5000.0 * self.wheels\n\n    def purchase_price(self):\n        if self.sold_on is None:\n            return 0.0  # Not yet sold\n        return 8000 - (.10 * self.miles)  OK, that looks pretty reasonable. Of course, we would likely have a number of other methods on the class, but I've shown two of particular interest to us:  sale_price  and  purchase_price . We'll see why these are important in a bit.  Now that we've got the  Car  class, perhaps we should create a  Truck  class? Let's follow the same pattern we did for car:  class Truck(object):\n    def __init__(self, wheels, miles, make, model, year, sold_on):\n        self.wheels = wheels\n        self.miles = miles\n        self.make = make\n        self.model = model\n        self.year = year\n        self.sold_on = sold_on\n\n    def sale_price(self):\n        if self.sold_on is not None:\n            return 0.0  # Already sold\n        return 5000.0 * self.wheels\n\n    def purchase_price(self):\n        if self.sold_on is None:\n            return 0.0  # Not yet sold\n        return 10000 - (.10 * self.miles)  Wow.

            "text": "Running several threads is similar to running several different programs concurrently, but with the following benefits\n\n\n\n\nMultiple threads within a process share the same data space with the main thread and can therefore share information or communicate with each other more easily than if they were separate processes.\n\n\nThreads sometimes called light-weight processes and they do not require much memory overhead; they are cheaper than processes.\n\n\n\n\nA thread has a beginning, an execution sequence, and a conclusion. It has an instruction pointer that keeps track of where within its context it is currently running.\n\n\n\n\nIt can be pre-empted (interrupted)\n\n\nIt can temporarily be put on hold (also known as sleeping) while other threads are running - this is called yielding.\n\n\n\n\nStarting a New Thread\n\n\nTo spawn another thread, you need to call following method available in thread module:\n\n\nthread.start_new_thread ( function, args[, kwargs] )\n\n\n\n\nThis method call enables a fast and efficient way to create new threads in both Linux and Windows.\n\n\nThe method call returns immediately and the child thread starts and calls function with the passed list of args. When function returns, the thread terminates.\n\n\nHere, args is a tuple of arguments; use an empty tuple to call function without passing any arguments. kwargs is an optional dictionary of keyword arguments.\n\n\nExample\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport thread\nimport time\n\n# Define a function for the thread\ndef print_time( threadName, delay):\n   count = 0\n   while count \n 5:\n      time.sleep(delay)\n      count += 1\n      print \n%s: %s\n % ( threadName, time.ctime(time.time()) )\n\n# Create two threads as follows\ntry:\n   thread.start_new_thread( print_time, (\nThread-1\n, 2, ) )\n   thread.start_new_thread( print_time, (\nThread-2\n, 4, ) )\nexcept:\n   print \nError: unable to start thread\n\n\nwhile 1:\n   pass\n\n\n\n\nWhen the above code is executed, it produces the following result\n\n\nThread-1: Thu Jan 22 15:42:17 2009\nThread-1: Thu Jan 22 15:42:19 2009\nThread-2: Thu Jan 22 15:42:19 2009\nThread-1: Thu Jan 22 15:42:21 2009\nThread-2: Thu Jan 22 15:42:23 2009\nThread-1: Thu Jan 22 15:42:23 2009\nThread-1: Thu Jan 22 15:42:25 2009\nThread-2: Thu Jan 22 15:42:27 2009\nThread-2: Thu Jan 22 15:42:31 2009\nThread-2: Thu Jan 22 15:42:35 2009\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it is very effective for low-level threading, but the thread module is very limited compared to the newer threading module.\n\n\nThe Threading Module\n\n\nThe newer threading module included with Python 2.4 provides much more powerful, high-level support for threads than the thread module discussed in the previous section.\n\n\nThe threading module exposes all the methods of the thread module and provides some additional methods:\n\n\n\n\nthreading.activeCount()\n: Returns the number of thread objects that are active.\n\n\nthreading.currentThread()\n: Returns the number of thread objects in the caller's thread control.\n\n\nthreading.enumerate()\n: Returns a list of all thread objects that are currently active.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the methods, the threading module has the Thread class that implements threading. The methods provided by the Thread class are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nrun()\n: The run() method is the entry point for a thread.\n\n\nstart()\n: The start() method starts a thread by calling the run method.\n\n\njoin([time])\n: The join() waits for threads to terminate.\n\n\nisAlive(): The isAlive() method checks whether a thread is still executing.\n\n\ngetName()\n: The getName() method returns the name of a thread.\n\n\nsetName()\n: The setName() method sets the name of a thread.\n\n\n\n\nCreating Thread Using Threading Module\n\n\nTo implement a new thread using the threading module, you have to do the following \u2212\n\n\n\n\nDefine a new subclass of the Thread class.\n\n\nOverride the \ninit\n(self [,args]) method to add additional arguments.\n\n\nThen, override the run(self [,args]) method to implement what the thread should do when started.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have created the new Thread subclass, you can create an instance of it and then start a new thread by invoking the start(), which in turn calls run() method.\n\n\nExample\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport threading\nimport time\n\nexitFlag = 0\n\nclass myThread (threading.Thread):\n    def __init__(self, threadID, name, counter):\n        threading.Thread.__init__(self)\n        self.threadID = threadID\n        self.name = name\n        self.counter = counter\n    def run(self):\n        print \nStarting \n + self.name\n        print_time(self.name, self.counter, 5)\n        print \nExiting \n + self.name\n\ndef print_time(threadName, delay, counter):\n    while counter:\n        if exitFlag:\n            threadName.exit()\n        time.sleep(delay)\n        print \n%s: %s\n % (threadName, time.ctime(time.time()))\n        counter -= 1\n\n# Create new threads\nthread1 = myThread(1, \nThread-1\n, 1)\nthread2 = myThread(2, \nThread-2\n, 2)\n\n# Start new Threads\nthread1.start()\nthread2.start()\n\nprint \nExiting Main Thread\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the above code is executed, it produces the following result\n\n\nStarting Thread-1\nStarting Thread-2\nExiting Main Thread\nThread-1: Thu Mar 21 09:10:03 2013\nThread-1: Thu Mar 21 09:10:04 2013\nThread-2: Thu Mar 21 09:10:04 2013\nThread-1: Thu Mar 21 09:10:05 2013\nThread-1: Thu Mar 21 09:10:06 2013\nThread-2: Thu Mar 21 09:10:06 2013\nThread-1: Thu Mar 21 09:10:07 2013\nExiting Thread-1\nThread-2: Thu Mar 21 09:10:08 2013\nThread-2: Thu Mar 21 09:10:10 2013\nThread-2: Thu Mar 21 09:10:12 2013\nExiting Thread-2\n\n\n\n\nSynchronizing Threads\n\n\nThe threading module provided with Python includes a simple-to-implement locking mechanism that allows you to synchronize threads. A new lock is created by calling the Lock() method, which returns the new lock.\n\n\nThe acquire(blocking) method of the new lock object is used to force threads to run synchronously. The optional blocking parameter enables you to control whether the thread waits to acquire the lock.\n\n\nIf blocking is set to 0, the thread returns immediately with a 0 value if the lock cannot be acquired and with a 1 if the lock was acquired. If blocking is set to 1, the thread blocks and wait for the lock to be released.\n\n\nThe release() method of the new lock object is used to release the lock when it is no longer required.\n\n\nExample\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport threading\nimport time\n\nclass myThread (threading.Thread):\n    def __init__(self, threadID, name, counter):\n        threading.Thread.__init__(self)\n        self.threadID = threadID\n        self.name = name\n        self.counter = counter\n    def run(self):\n        print \nStarting \n + self.name\n        # Get lock to synchronize threads\n        threadLock.acquire()\n        print_time(self.name, self.counter, 3)\n        # Free lock to release next thread\n        threadLock.release()\n\ndef print_time(threadName, delay, counter):\n    while counter:\n        time.sleep(delay)\n        print \n%s: %s\n % (threadName, time.ctime(time.time()))\n        counter -= 1\n\nthreadLock = threading.Lock()\nthreads = []\n\n# Create new threads\nthread1 = myThread(1, \nThread-1\n, 1)\nthread2 = myThread(2, \nThread-2\n, 2)\n\n# Start new Threads\nthread1.start()\nthread2.start()\n\n# Add threads to thread list\nthreads.append(thread1)\nthreads.append(thread2)\n\n# Wait for all threads to complete\nfor t in threads:\n    t.join()\nprint \nExiting Main Thread\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the above code is executed, it produces the following result\n\n\nStarting Thread-1\nStarting Thread-2\nStarting Thread-3\nThread-1 processing One\nThread-2 processing Two\nThread-3 processing Three\nThread-1 processing Four\nThread-2 processing Five\nExiting Thread-3\nExiting Thread-1\nExiting Thread-2\nExiting Main Thread\n\n\n\n\nRelated Readings\n\n\n\n\n\"Python Multithreaded Programming\". \nwww.tutorialspoint.com\n.

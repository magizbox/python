            "text": "Yield and Generators\n\n\nCoroutines and Subroutines\n\n\nWhen we call a normal Python function, execution starts at function's first line and continues until a return statement, exception, or the end of the function (which is seen as an implicit return None) is encountered. Once a function returns control to its caller, that's it. Any work done by the function and stored in local variables is lost. A new call to the function creates everything from scratch.\n\n\nThis is all very standard when discussing functions (more generally referred to as subroutines) in computer programming. There are times, though, when it's beneficial to have the ability to create a \"function\" which, instead of simply returning a single value, is able to yield a series of values. To do so, such a function would need to be able to \"save its work,\" so to speak.\n\n\nI said, \"yield a series of values\" because our hypothetical function doesn't \"return\" in the normal sense. return implies that the function is returning control of execution to the point where the function was called. \"Yield,\" however, implies that the transfer of control is temporary and voluntary, and our function expects to regain it in the future.\n\n\nIn Python, \"functions\" with these capabilities are called generators, and they're incredibly useful. generators (and the yield statement) were initially introduced to give programmers a more straightforward way to write code responsible for producing a series of values. Previously, creating something like a random number generator required a class or module that both generated values and kept track of state between calls. With the introduction of generators, this became much simpler.\n\n\nTo better understand the problem generators solve, let's take a look at an example. Throughout the example, keep in mind the core problem being solved: generating a series of values.\n\n\nNote: Outside of Python, all but the simplest generators would be referred to as coroutines. I'll use the latter term later in the post. The important thing to remember is, in Python, everything described here as a coroutine is still a generator. Python formally defines the term generator; coroutine is used in discussion but has no formal definition in the language.\n\n\nExample: Fun With Prime Numbers\n\n\nSuppose our boss asks us to write a function that takes a list of ints and returns some Iterable containing the elements which are prime1 numbers.\n\n\nRemember, an Iterable is just an object capable of returning its members one at a time.\n\n\n\"Simple,\" we say, and we write the following:\n\n\ndef get_primes(input_list):\n    result_list = list()\n    for element in input_list:\n        if is_prime(element):\n            result_list.append()\n\n    return result_list\n\n\n\n\nor better yet...\n\n\ndef get_primes(input_list):\n    return (element for element in input_list if is_prime(element))\n\n# not germane to the example, but here's a possible implementation of\n# is_prime...\n\ndef is_prime(number):\n    if number \n 1:\n        if number == 2:\n            return True\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            return False\n        for current in range(3, int(math.sqrt(number) + 1), 2):\n            if number % current == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n    return False\n\n\n\n\nEither get_primes implementation above fulfills the requirements, so we tell our boss we're done. She reports our function works and is exactly what she wanted.\n\n\nDealing With Infinite Sequences\n\n\nWell, not quite exactly. A few days later, our boss comes back and tells us she's run into a small problem: she wants to use our get_primes function on a very large list of numbers. In fact, the list is so large that merely creating it would consume all of the system's memory. To work around this, she wants to be able to call get_primes with a start value and get all the primes larger than start (perhaps she's solving Project Euler problem 10).\n\n\nOnce we think about this new requirement, it becomes clear that it requires more than a simple change to get_primes. Clearly, we can't return a list of all the prime numbers from start to infinity (operating on infinite sequences, though, has a wide range of useful applications). The chances of solving this problem using a normal function seem bleak.\n\n\nBefore we give up, let's determine the core obstacle preventing us from writing a function that satisfies our boss's new requirements. Thinking about it, we arrive at the following: functions only get one chance to return results, and thus must return all results at once. It seems pointless to make such an obvious statement; \"functions just work that way,\" we think. The real value lies in asking, \"but what if they didn't?\"\n\n\nImagine what we could do if get_primes could simply return the next value instead of all the values at once. It wouldn't need to create a list at all. No list, no memory issues. Since our boss told us she's just iterating over the results, she wouldn't know the difference.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this doesn't seem possible. Even if we had a magical function that allowed us to iterate from n to infinity, we'd get stuck after returning the first value:\n\n\ndef get_primes(start):\n    for element in magical_infinite_range(start):\n        if is_prime(element):\n            return element\n\n\n\n\nImagine get_primes is called like so:\n\n\ndef solve_number_10():\n    # She *is* working on Project Euler #10, I knew it!\n    total = 2\n    for next_prime in get_primes(3):\n        if next_prime \n 2000000:\n            total += next_prime\n        else:\n            print(total)\n            return\n\n\n\n\nClearly, in get_primes, we would immediately hit the case where number = 3 and return at line 4. Instead of return, we need a way to generate a value and, when asked for the next one, pick up where we left off.\n\n\nFunctions, though, can't do this. When they return, they're done for good. Even if we could guarantee a function would be called again, we have no way of saying, \"OK, now, instead of starting at the first line like we normally do, start up where we left off at line 4.\" Functions have a single entry point: the first line.\n\n\nEnter the Generator\n\n\nThis sort of problem is so common that a new construct was added to Python to solve it: the generator. A generator \"generates\" values. Creating generators was made as straightforward as possible through the concept of generator functions, introduced simultaneously.\n\n\nA generator function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function (even if it also contains a return statement). There's nothing else we need to do to create one.\n\n\ngenerator functions create generator iterators. That's the last time you'll see the term generator iterator, though, since they're almost always referred to as \"generators\". Just remember that a generator is a special type of iterator. To be considered an iterator, generators must define a few methods, one of which is \nnext\n(). To get the next value from a generator, we use the same built-in function as for iterators: next().\n\n\nThis point bears repeating: to get the next value from a generator, we use the same built-in function as for iterators: next().\n\n\n(next() takes care of calling the generator's \nnext\n() method). Since a generator is a type of iterator, it can be used in a for loop.\n\n\nSo whenever next() is called on a generator, the generator is responsible for passing back a value to whomever called next(). It does so by calling yield along with the value to be passed back (e.g. yield 7). The easiest way to remember what yield does is to think of it as return (plus a little magic) for generator functions.**\n\n\nAgain, this bears repeating: yield is just return (plus a little magic) for generator functions.\n\n\nHere's a simple generator function:\n\n\n def simple_generator_function():\n\n    yield 1\n\n    yield 2\n\n    yield 3\n\n\n\n\nAnd here are two simple ways to use it:\n\n\n for value in simple_generator_function():\n\n     print(value)\n1\n2\n3\n\n our_generator = simple_generator_function()\n\n next(our_generator)\n1\n\n next(our_generator)\n2\n\n next(our_generator)\n3\n\n\n\n\nMagic?\n\n\nWhat's the magic part? Glad you asked! When a generator function calls yield, the \"state\" of the generator function is frozen; the values of all variables are saved and the next line of code to be executed is recorded until next() is called again. Once it is, the generator function simply resumes where it left off. If next() is never called again, the state recorded during the yield call is (eventually) discarded.\n\n\nLet's rewrite get_primes as a generator function. Notice that we no longer need the magical_infinite_range function. Using a simple while loop, we can create our own infinite sequence:\n\n\ndef get_primes(number):\n    while True:\n        if is_prime(number):\n            yield number\n        number += 1\n\n\n\n\nIf a generator function calls return or reaches the end its definition, a StopIteration exception is raised. This signals to whoever was calling next() that the generator is exhausted (this is normal iterator behavior). It is also the reason the while True: loop is present in get_primes. If it weren't, the first time next() was called we would check if the number is prime and possibly yield it. If next() were called again, we would uselessly add 1 to number and hit the end of the generator function (causing StopIteration to be raised). Once a generator has been exhausted, calling next() on it will result in an error, so you can only consume all the values of a generator once. The following will not work:\n\n\n our_generator = simple_generator_function()\n\n for value in our_generator:\n\n     print(value)\n\n\n # our_generator has been exhausted...\n\n print(next(our_generator))\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \nipython-input-13-7e48a609051a\n, line 1, in \nmodule\n\n    next(our_generator)\nStopIteration\n\n\n # however, we can always create a new generator\n\n # by calling the generator function again...\n\n\n new_generator = simple_generator_function()\n\n print(next(new_generator)) # perfectly valid\n1\n\n\n\n\nThus, the while loop is there to make sure we never reach the end of get_primes. It allows us to generate a value for as long as next() is called on the generator. This is a common idiom when dealing with infinite series (and generators in general).\n\n\nVisualizing the flow\n\n\nLet's go back to the code that was calling get_primes: solve_number_10.\n\n\ndef solve_number_10():\n    # She *is* working on Project Euler #10, I knew it!\n    total = 2\n    for next_prime in get_primes(3):\n        if next_prime \n 2000000:\n            total += next_prime\n        else:\n            print(total)\n            return\n\n\n\n\nIt's helpful to visualize how the first few elements are created when we call get_primes in solve_number_10's for loop. When the for loop requests the first value from get_primes, we enter get_primes as we would in a normal function.\n\n\n\n\nWe enter the while loop on line 3\n\n\nThe if condition holds (3 is prime)\n\n\nWe yield the value 3 and control to solve_number_10.\n\n\n\n\nThen, back in solve_number_10:\n\n\n\n\nThe value 3 is passed back to the for loop\n\n\nThe for loop assigns next_prime to this value\n\n\nnext_prime is added to total\n\n\nThe for loop requests the next element from get_primes\n\n\n\n\nThis time, though, instead of entering get_primes back at the top, we resume at line 5, where we left off.\n\n\ndef get_primes(number):\n    while True:\n        if is_prime(number):\n            yield number\n        number += 1 # \n\n\n\n\n\nMost importantly, number still has the same value it did when we called yield (i.e. 3). Remember, yield both passes a value to whoever called next(), and saves the \"state\" of the generator function. Clearly, then, number is incremented to 4, we hit the top of the while loop, and keep incrementing number until we hit the next prime number (5). Again we yield the value of number to the for loop in solve_number_10. This cycle continues until the for loop stops (at the first prime greater than 2,000,000).\n\n\nMoar Power\n\n\nIn PEP 342, support was added for passing values into generators. PEP 342 gave generators the power to yield a value (as before), receive a value, or both yield a value and receive a (possibly different) value in a single statement.\n\n\nTo illustrate how values are sent to a generator, let's return to our prime number example. This time, instead of simply printing every prime number greater than number, we'll find the smallest prime number greater than successive powers of a number (i.e. for 10, we want the smallest prime greater than 10, then 100, then 1000, etc.). We start in the same way as get_primes:\n\n\ndef print_successive_primes(iterations, base=10):\n    # like normal functions, a generator function\n    # can be assigned to a variable\n\n    prime_generator = get_primes(base)\n    # missing code...\n    for power in range(iterations):\n        # missing code...\n\ndef get_primes(number):\n    while True:\n        if is_prime(number):\n        # ... what goes here?\n\n\n\n\nThe next line of get_primes takes a bit of explanation. While yield number would yield the value of number, a statement of the form other = yield foo means, \"yield foo and, when a value is sent to me, set other to that value.\" You can \"send\" values to a generator using the generator's send method.\n\n\ndef get_primes(number):\n    while True:\n        if is_prime(number):\n            number = yield number\n        number += 1\n\n\n\n\nIn this way, we can set number to a different value each time the generator yields. We can now fill in the missing code in print_successive_primes:\n\n\ndef print_successive_primes(iterations, base=10):\n    prime_generator = get_primes(base)\n    prime_generator.send(None)\n    for power in range(iterations):\n        print(prime_generator.send(base ** power))\n\n\n\n\nTwo things to note here: First, we're printing the result of generator.send, which is possible because send both sends a value to the generator and returns the value yielded by the generator (mirroring how yield works from within the generator function).\n\n\nSecond, notice the prime_generator.send(None) line. When you're using send to \"start\" a generator (that is, execute the code from the first line of the generator function up to the first yield statement), you must send None. This makes sense, since by definition the generator hasn't gotten to the first yield statement yet, so if we sent a real value there would be nothing to \"receive\" it. Once the generator is started, we can send values as we do above.\n\n\nRound-up\n\n\nIn the second half of this series, we'll discuss the various ways in which generators have been enhanced and the power they gained as a result. yield has become one of the most powerful keywords in Python. Now that we've built a solid understanding of how yield works, we have the knowledge necessary to understand some of the more \"mind-bending\" things that yield can be used for.\n\n\nBelieve it or not, we've barely scratched the surface of the power of yield. For example, while send does work as described above, it's almost never used when generating simple sequences like our example. Below, I've pasted a small demonstration of one common way send is used.

            "text": "When we call a normal Python function, execution starts at function's first line and continues until a return statement, exception, or the end of the function (which is seen as an implicit return None) is encountered. Once a function returns control to its caller, that's it. Any work done by the function and stored in local variables is lost. A new call to the function creates everything from scratch.  This is all very standard when discussing functions (more generally referred to as subroutines) in computer programming. There are times, though, when it's beneficial to have the ability to create a \"function\" which, instead of simply returning a single value, is able to yield a series of values. To do so, such a function would need to be able to \"save its work,\" so to speak.  I said, \"yield a series of values\" because our hypothetical function doesn't \"return\" in the normal sense. return implies that the function is returning control of execution to the point where the function was called. \"Yield,\" however, implies that the transfer of control is temporary and voluntary, and our function expects to regain it in the future.  In Python, \"functions\" with these capabilities are called generators, and they're incredibly useful. generators (and the yield statement) were initially introduced to give programmers a more straightforward way to write code responsible for producing a series of values. Previously, creating something like a random number generator required a class or module that both generated values and kept track of state between calls. With the introduction of generators, this became much simpler.  To better understand the problem generators solve, let's take a look at an example. Throughout the example, keep in mind the core problem being solved: generating a series of values.  Note: Outside of Python, all but the simplest generators would be referred to as coroutines. I'll use the latter term later in the post. The important thing to remember is, in Python, everything described here as a coroutine is still a generator. Python formally defines the term generator; coroutine is used in discussion but has no formal definition in the language.",

            "text": "Well, not quite exactly. A few days later, our boss comes back and tells us she's run into a small problem: she wants to use our get_primes function on a very large list of numbers. In fact, the list is so large that merely creating it would consume all of the system's memory. To work around this, she wants to be able to call get_primes with a start value and get all the primes larger than start (perhaps she's solving Project Euler problem 10).  Once we think about this new requirement, it becomes clear that it requires more than a simple change to get_primes. Clearly, we can't return a list of all the prime numbers from start to infinity (operating on infinite sequences, though, has a wide range of useful applications). The chances of solving this problem using a normal function seem bleak.  Before we give up, let's determine the core obstacle preventing us from writing a function that satisfies our boss's new requirements. Thinking about it, we arrive at the following: functions only get one chance to return results, and thus must return all results at once. It seems pointless to make such an obvious statement; \"functions just work that way,\" we think. The real value lies in asking, \"but what if they didn't?\"  Imagine what we could do if get_primes could simply return the next value instead of all the values at once. It wouldn't need to create a list at all. No list, no memory issues. Since our boss told us she's just iterating over the results, she wouldn't know the difference.  Unfortunately, this doesn't seem possible. Even if we had a magical function that allowed us to iterate from n to infinity, we'd get stuck after returning the first value:  def get_primes(start):\n    for element in magical_infinite_range(start):\n        if is_prime(element):\n            return element  Imagine get_primes is called like so:  def solve_number_10():\n    # She *is* working on Project Euler #10, I knew it!\n    total = 2\n    for next_prime in get_primes(3):\n        if next_prime   2000000:\n            total += next_prime\n        else:\n            print(total)\n            return  Clearly, in get_primes, we would immediately hit the case where number = 3 and return at line 4. Instead of return, we need a way to generate a value and, when asked for the next one, pick up where we left off.  Functions, though, can't do this. When they return, they're done for good. Even if we could guarantee a function would be called again, we have no way of saying, \"OK, now, instead of starting at the first line like we normally do, start up where we left off at line 4.\" Functions have a single entry point: the first line.",

            "text": "This sort of problem is so common that a new construct was added to Python to solve it: the generator. A generator \"generates\" values. Creating generators was made as straightforward as possible through the concept of generator functions, introduced simultaneously.  A generator function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function (even if it also contains a return statement). There's nothing else we need to do to create one.  generator functions create generator iterators. That's the last time you'll see the term generator iterator, though, since they're almost always referred to as \"generators\". Just remember that a generator is a special type of iterator. To be considered an iterator, generators must define a few methods, one of which is  next (). To get the next value from a generator, we use the same built-in function as for iterators: next().  This point bears repeating: to get the next value from a generator, we use the same built-in function as for iterators: next().  (next() takes care of calling the generator's  next () method).

I'll not say any more about it as figuring out how and why it works will be a good warm-up for part two.  import random\n\ndef get_data():\n     Return 3 random integers between 0 and 9 \n    return random.sample(range(10), 3)\n\ndef consume():\n     Displays a running average across lists of integers sent to it \n    running_sum = 0\n    data_items_seen = 0\n\n    while True:\n        data = yield\n        data_items_seen += len(data)\n        running_sum += sum(data)\n        print('The running average is {}'.format(running_sum / float(data_items_seen)))\n\ndef produce(consumer):\n     Produces a set of values and forwards them to the pre-defined consumer\n    function \n    while True:\n        data = get_data()\n        print('Produced {}'.format(data))\n        consumer.send(data)\n        yield\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    consumer = consume()\n    consumer.send(None)\n    producer = produce(consumer)\n\n    for _ in range(10):\n        print('Producing...')\n        next(producer)",

This introduction will explain the theoretical aspects of regular expressions and will show you how to use them in Python scripts. \n\n\nRegular Expressions are used in programming languages to filter texts or textstrings. It's possible to check, if a text or a string matches a regular expression. \n\n\nThere is an aspect of regular expressions which shouldn't go unmentioned: The syntax of regular expressions is the same for all programming and script languages, e.g. Python, Perl, Java, SED, AWK and even X#.\n\n\nFunctions\n\n\nmatch function\n\n\nThis function attempts to match RE pattern to string with optional flags.\n\n\nre.match(pattern, string, flags=0)\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nimport re\n\nline = \nCats are smarter than dogs\n\n\nmatched_object = re.match(r'(.*) are (.*?) .*', line, re.M | re.I)\n\nif matched_object:\n    print \nmatched_object.group()  : \n, matched_object.group()\n    print \nmatched_object.group(1) : \n, matched_object.group(1)\n    print \nmatched_object.group(2) : \n, matched_object.group(2)\nelse:\n    print \nNo match!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the code is executed, it produces following results\n\n\nmatched_object.group()  :  Cats are smarter than dogs\nmatched_object.group(1) :  Cats\nmatched_object.group(2) :  smarter\n\n\n\n\nsearch function\n\n\nThis function searches for first occurrence of RE pattern within stirng with optional flags\n\n\nre.search(pattern, string, flags=0)\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport re\n\nline = \nCats are smarter than dogs\n\n\nsearch_object = re.search(r'dogs', line, re.M | re.I)\nif search_object:\n    print \nsearch --\n search_object.group() : \n, search_object.group()\nelse:\n    print \nNothing found!!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the code is executed, it produces following results\n\n\nsearch --\n search_object.group() :  dogs\n\n\n\n\nsub function\n\n\nThis method replaces all occurrences of the RE pattern in string with repl, substituting all occurrences unless max provided. This method returns modified string.\n\n\nre.sub(pattern, repl, string, max=0)\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport re\n\nphone = \n2004-959-559 # This is Phone Number\n\n\n# Delete Python-style comments\nnum = re.sub(r'#.*$', \n, phone)\nprint \nPhone Num : \n, num\n\n# Remove anything other than digits\nnum = re.sub(r'\\D', \n, phone)    \nprint \nPhone Num : \n, num\n\n\n\n\nWhen the code is executed, it produces following results\n\n\nPhone Num :  2004-959-559\nPhone Num :  2004959559\n\n\n\n\nTokens Cheatsheet\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacter Classes\n\n\n\n\n.\n \nany character except newline\n\n\n\n\n /go\n.\ngle/ \n\n\n \ngoogle\n \ngoggle\n gogle \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\w \\d \\s\n \nword, digit, whitespace\n\n\n\n\n /\n\\w\n/ \n\n\n \nAaYyz09\n ?! \n\n\n /\n\\d\n/ \n\n\n \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n aZ? \n\n\n /\n\\s\n/ \n\n\n 0123456789\n \nabcd?/ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\W \\D \\S\n \nnot word, digit, whitespace\n\n\n\n\n /\n\\W\n/ \n\n\n abcded\n1234\n \n?\n>\n\n\n /\n\\D\n/ \n\n\n \na\nb\nc\n 12345 \n?\n<\n.\n\n\n /\n\\S\n/ \n\n\n \na\nb\nc\n1\n2\n3\n?\n<\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[abc]\n \nany of a, b or c\n\n\n\n\n /analy\n[\nsz\n]\ne/ \n\n\nanalyse\n \nanalyze\n analyxe \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[^abc]\n \nnot a, b or c\n\n\n\n\n /analy\n[\nsz\n]\ne/ \n\n\nanalyse analyze \nanalyxe\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[a-g]\n \ncharacter between a \n&\n g\n\n\n\n\n /\n[\n2\n-\n4\n]\n/ \n\n\n demo1 \ndemo2\n \ndemo3\n \ndemo4\n demo5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnchors\n\n\n^abc$\n \nstart / end of the string\n\n\n\n\n /\n^abc$\n/ \n\n\n \nabc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\b \\B\n \n word, not-word boundary\n\n\n\n\n /\n\\b\nis\n\\b\n/ \n\n\nThis island \n\n\nis\n beautiful.\n\n\n /\n\\B\ncat\n\\B\n/ \n\n\n cat certifi\ncat\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEscaped characters\n\n\n\\. \\* \\\\\n \nescaped special characters\n\n\n\n\n /\n\\.\n/ \n\n\n username@exampe\n.\ncom 300\n.\n000 USD\n\n\n /\n\\*\n/ \n\n\n abc@\n&\n%$\n*\n123\n\n\n /\n\\\\\n/ \n\n\n abc@\n&\n%$\n\\\\\n123\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\t \\n \\r\n \ntab, linefeed, carriage return\n\n\n\n\n /\n\\t\n/ \n\n\n abc\ndef\n\n\n /ab\n\\n\n/ \n\n\n \nab\n\n\n /\n\\r\n/ \n\n\n abc@\n&\n%$\n\\\\\n123\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\u00A9\n \nunicode escaped \u00a9\n\n\n /\n\\u00A9\n/ \n\n\n Copyright\n\u00a9\n2017 - All rights reserved\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroups and Lockaround\n\n\n(abc)\n \ncapture group\n\n\n\n\n /\n(\ndemo\n|\nexample\n)\n[0-9]\n/ \n\n\n \ndemo1\nexample4\ndemo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\1\n \nbackreference to group #1\n\n\n\n\n /\n(\nabc\n|\ndef\n)\n=\n\\1\n/\n\n\n \nabc=abc\n \ndef=def\nabc=def \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(?:abc)\n \nnon-capturing group\n\n\n\n\n /\n(\n?:\nabc\n)\n{3}\n/\n\n\n \nabcabcabc\n abcabc\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(?=abc)\n \npositive lookahead\n\n\n\n\n /t\n(?=\ns\n)\n/\n\n\n tt\nt\nssstt\nt\nss \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(?!abc)\n \nnegative lookahead\n\n\n\n\n /t\n(?!\ns\n)\n/\n\n\n \nt\nt\ntsss\nt\nt\ntss \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(?\n<\n=abc)\n \npositive lookbehind\n\n\n\n\n /\n(?\n<\n=\nfoo\n)\nbar/\n\n\n foo\nbar\n fuubar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(?\n!abc)\n \nnegative lookbehind\n\n\n\n\n /\n(?\n!\nfoo\n)\nbar/ \n\n\n foobar fuu\nbar\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantifiers \n&\n Alternation\n\n\na* a+ a?\n \n0 or more, 1 or more, 0 or 1\n\n\n\n\n /go\n*\ngle/ \n\n\n \ngogle\n \ngooooogle\n goggle\n\n\n /go\n+\ngle/ \n\n\n gogle \ngooooogle\n goggle\n\n\n /demos\n?\n123/ \n\n\n \ndemos123\n demosA123 demos?123\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na{5}, a{2,}\n \nexactly five, two or more\n\n\n\n\n /w\n{3}\n/ \n\n\n \nwww\n.google.com\n\n\n /go\n{2,}\ngle/ \n\n\n \ngooooogle\n goggle\n\n\n\n\n\n\na{1,3}\n \nbetween one \n&\n three\n\n\n\n\n /a\n{4,7}\n/ \n\n\n \naaaa\n \naaaaaa\n aa\n\n\n\n\n\n\na+? a{2,}?\n \nmatch as few as possible\n\n\n\n\n /a\n+?\n/ \n\n\n \na\n \naa\n \naaaaaa\n\n\n /a\n{2,}?\n/ \n\n\n a \naa\n \naaaaaa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nab|cd\n \nmatch ab or cd\n\n\n\n\n /demo\n|\nexample/ \n\n\n \ndemo\n \nexample\n \nexample\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Readings\n\n\n\n\nOnline regex tester and debugger: PHP, PCRE, Python, Golang and JavaScript, \nregex101.com\n\n\nRegExr: Learn, Build, \n Test RegEx, \nregexr.com",

            "text": "Running several threads is similar to running several different programs concurrently, but with the following benefits\n\n\n\n\nMultiple threads within a process share the same data space with the main thread and can therefore share information or communicate with each other more easily than if they were separate processes.\n\n\nThreads sometimes called light-weight processes and they do not require much memory overhead; they are cheaper than processes.\n\n\n\n\nA thread has a beginning, an execution sequence, and a conclusion. It has an instruction pointer that keeps track of where within its context it is currently running.\n\n\n\n\nIt can be pre-empted (interrupted)\n\n\nIt can temporarily be put on hold (also known as sleeping) while other threads are running - this is called yielding.\n\n\n\n\nStarting a New Thread\n\n\nTo spawn another thread, you need to call following method available in thread module:\n\n\nthread.start_new_thread ( function, args[, kwargs] )\n\n\n\n\nThis method call enables a fast and efficient way to create new threads in both Linux and Windows.\n\n\nThe method call returns immediately and the child thread starts and calls function with the passed list of args. When function returns, the thread terminates.\n\n\nHere, args is a tuple of arguments; use an empty tuple to call function without passing any arguments. kwargs is an optional dictionary of keyword arguments.\n\n\nExample\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport thread\nimport time\n\n# Define a function for the thread\ndef print_time( threadName, delay):\n   count = 0\n   while count \n 5:\n      time.sleep(delay)\n      count += 1\n      print \n%s: %s\n % ( threadName, time.ctime(time.time()) )\n\n# Create two threads as follows\ntry:\n   thread.start_new_thread( print_time, (\nThread-1\n, 2, ) )\n   thread.start_new_thread( print_time, (\nThread-2\n, 4, ) )\nexcept:\n   print \nError: unable to start thread\n\n\nwhile 1:\n   pass\n\n\n\n\nWhen the above code is executed, it produces the following result\n\n\nThread-1: Thu Jan 22 15:42:17 2009\nThread-1: Thu Jan 22 15:42:19 2009\nThread-2: Thu Jan 22 15:42:19 2009\nThread-1: Thu Jan 22 15:42:21 2009\nThread-2: Thu Jan 22 15:42:23 2009\nThread-1: Thu Jan 22 15:42:23 2009\nThread-1: Thu Jan 22 15:42:25 2009\nThread-2: Thu Jan 22 15:42:27 2009\nThread-2: Thu Jan 22 15:42:31 2009\nThread-2: Thu Jan 22 15:42:35 2009\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it is very effective for low-level threading, but the thread module is very limited compared to the newer threading module.\n\n\nThe Threading Module\n\n\nThe newer threading module included with Python 2.4 provides much more powerful, high-level support for threads than the thread module discussed in the previous section.\n\n\nThe threading module exposes all the methods of the thread module and provides some additional methods:\n\n\n\n\nthreading.activeCount()\n: Returns the number of thread objects that are active.\n\n\nthreading.currentThread()\n: Returns the number of thread objects in the caller's thread control.\n\n\nthreading.enumerate()\n: Returns a list of all thread objects that are currently active.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the methods, the threading module has the Thread class that implements threading. The methods provided by the Thread class are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nrun()\n: The run() method is the entry point for a thread.\n\n\nstart()\n: The start() method starts a thread by calling the run method.\n\n\njoin([time])\n: The join() waits for threads to terminate.\n\n\nisAlive(): The isAlive() method checks whether a thread is still executing.\n\n\ngetName()\n: The getName() method returns the name of a thread.\n\n\nsetName()\n: The setName() method sets the name of a thread.\n\n\n\n\nCreating Thread Using Threading Module\n\n\nTo implement a new thread using the threading module, you have to do the following \u2212\n\n\n\n\nDefine a new subclass of the Thread class.\n\n\nOverride the \ninit\n(self [,args]) method to add additional arguments.\n\n\nThen, override the run(self [,args]) method to implement what the thread should do when started.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have created the new Thread subclass, you can create an instance of it and then start a new thread by invoking the start(), which in turn calls run() method.\n\n\nExample\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport threading\nimport time\n\nexitFlag = 0\n\nclass myThread (threading.Thread):\n    def __init__(self, threadID, name, counter):\n        threading.Thread.__init__(self)\n        self.threadID = threadID\n        self.name = name\n        self.counter = counter\n    def run(self):\n        print \nStarting \n + self.name\n        print_time(self.name, self.counter, 5)\n        print \nExiting \n + self.name\n\ndef print_time(threadName, delay, counter):\n    while counter:\n        if exitFlag:\n            threadName.exit()\n        time.sleep(delay)\n        print \n%s: %s\n % (threadName, time.ctime(time.time()))\n        counter -= 1\n\n# Create new threads\nthread1 = myThread(1, \nThread-1\n, 1)\nthread2 = myThread(2, \nThread-2\n, 2)\n\n# Start new Threads\nthread1.start()\nthread2.start()\n\nprint \nExiting Main Thread\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the above code is executed, it produces the following result\n\n\nStarting Thread-1\nStarting Thread-2\nExiting Main Thread\nThread-1: Thu Mar 21 09:10:03 2013\nThread-1: Thu Mar 21 09:10:04 2013\nThread-2: Thu Mar 21 09:10:04 2013\nThread-1: Thu Mar 21 09:10:05 2013\nThread-1: Thu Mar 21 09:10:06 2013\nThread-2: Thu Mar 21 09:10:06 2013\nThread-1: Thu Mar 21 09:10:07 2013\nExiting Thread-1\nThread-2: Thu Mar 21 09:10:08 2013\nThread-2: Thu Mar 21 09:10:10 2013\nThread-2: Thu Mar 21 09:10:12 2013\nExiting Thread-2\n\n\n\n\nSynchronizing Threads\n\n\nThe threading module provided with Python includes a simple-to-implement locking mechanism that allows you to synchronize threads. A new lock is created by calling the Lock() method, which returns the new lock.\n\n\nThe acquire(blocking) method of the new lock object is used to force threads to run synchronously. The optional blocking parameter enables you to control whether the thread waits to acquire the lock.\n\n\nIf blocking is set to 0, the thread returns immediately with a 0 value if the lock cannot be acquired and with a 1 if the lock was acquired. If blocking is set to 1, the thread blocks and wait for the lock to be released.\n\n\nThe release() method of the new lock object is used to release the lock when it is no longer required.\n\n\nExample\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport threading\nimport time\n\nclass myThread (threading.Thread):\n    def __init__(self, threadID, name, counter):\n        threading.Thread.__init__(self)\n        self.threadID = threadID\n        self.name = name\n        self.counter = counter\n    def run(self):\n        print \nStarting \n + self.name\n        # Get lock to synchronize threads\n        threadLock.acquire()\n        print_time(self.name, self.counter, 3)\n        # Free lock to release next thread\n        threadLock.release()\n\ndef print_time(threadName, delay, counter):\n    while counter:\n        time.sleep(delay)\n        print \n%s: %s\n % (threadName, time.ctime(time.time()))\n        counter -= 1\n\nthreadLock = threading.Lock()\nthreads = []\n\n# Create new threads\nthread1 = myThread(1, \nThread-1\n, 1)\nthread2 = myThread(2, \nThread-2\n, 2)\n\n# Start new Threads\nthread1.start()\nthread2.start()\n\n# Add threads to thread list\nthreads.append(thread1)\nthreads.append(thread2)\n\n# Wait for all threads to complete\nfor t in threads:\n    t.join()\nprint \nExiting Main Thread\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the above code is executed, it produces the following result\n\n\nStarting Thread-1\nStarting Thread-2\nStarting Thread-3\nThread-1 processing One\nThread-2 processing Two\nThread-3 processing Three\nThread-1 processing Four\nThread-2 processing Five\nExiting Thread-3\nExiting Thread-1\nExiting Thread-2\nExiting Main Thread\n\n\n\n\nRelated Readings\n\n\n\n\n\"Python Multithreaded Programming\". \nwww.tutorialspoint.com\n.
